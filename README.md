# Citizen-Information-Portal

This Python-based program simulates a Citizen Information Portal, allowing users to manage accounts, access land regulations, government schemes, administrative procedures, upload documents, provide feedback, and view official contacts. It features a simple menu-driven interface and includes secure password handling using SHA-256 hashing.

# Key Features:

User Authentication: Users can set and log in with their own passwords, which are securely hashed.

Information Module: Add and view land regulations, government schemes, and administrative procedures.

Document Repository: Upload and retrieve documents.

Feedback Module: Provide and view feedback.

Resource Directory: Add and view official contacts for different departments.

This project demonstrates basic information management, security through password hashing, and a flexible, text-based interaction system using Python dictionaries and lists. It could be expanded for real-world applications like citizen services.
